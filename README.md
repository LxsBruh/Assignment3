Reflection:

Through the start of the project I had originally used ChatGPT to "write me the html and css for a basic website page". This had created the basics of a header, footer and navigation. I had kept the basic page made for the rest of the project. Once I had got the basics I started by adding photos and text ,either through paragraphs or lists, to have the content ready to move around using css. The overall look I went for was inspired by NatGeo website pages, where there were lots of images that can be interacted with rather than huge text boxes. 

Key ChatGPT spots:
For the slideshow I had asked chatgpt to "make a box that rotates through images using html and css" this lead to the requirement of javascript, suggested by ai. This made a simple fading slideshow, but it did not take into account the different image sizes. I fixed this issue by adding my own paramiters to the height and width while also using @meadia screen for responsiveness, to ensure all images were sized correctly.
Chatgpt also did assist with creating the basics of the grids, but once again had to be corrected as, for example, the text for the list went behind the images and had also shifted off the left hand side of the screen. To fix this adding my own flex and justify styles to the div allowed for me to shift as needed.
The last aspect that Chatgpt mainly helped with was the metro tile sheet. This allowed for me to create image spots that could later be coded to be individual website pages. The only aspect I had to correct was the responsive design aspect as they would not compact when moved to smaller screen sizes.

Overall Chatgpt helped in troubleshooting the bigger tasks like creating buttons, slideshows and grids. Where in creating smaller and more specific details, it tended to leave them out meaning I had to read through the code carefully to assure it would work with my current code. 

I feel that overall, even though it is a pretty basic site, I have improved quite a lot in understanding what code I needed to use to solve solutions. This could be using grid systems and knowing how to adjust the content within the grids, resizing and making sure that they would adjust to screen sizes, and adding extra details for style choice. Some of the style choices I would implement in future projects is the hover buttons, on the navigation and metro squares, these added a little extra movement to the 2d aspects. I am also happy with the small detail of the footer scrolling with the page and also the button at the bottom that scrolls the page back to the top.
