                <h1>Fun Frog Facts</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variety of Species: There are over 7,000 species of frogs found worldwide, inhabiting diverse environments from tropical rainforests to deserts.</li>
                    <li>Skin Breathes: Frogs don't drink water through their mouths like mammals; instead, they absorb it through their skin. This also allows them to breathe through their skin.</li>
                    <li>Camouflage Masters: Many frog species have evolved remarkable camouflage abilities to blend into their surroundings, helping them evade predators.</li>
                    <li>Jumping Champions: Frogs are famous for their jumping abilities. Some species can leap up to 20 times their body length in a single jump, thanks to their powerful leg muscles.</li>
                    <li>Tongue Precision: Frogs have specialized tongues attached to the front of their mouths, which they can shoot out with incredible speed and accuracy to catch prey.</li>
                    <li>Nocturnal Serenades: Male frogs are known for their distinctive calls, which they use to attract females during the breeding season. Each species has its own unique call.</li>
                    <li>Long Lifespans: While lifespans vary among species, some frogs can live for several years in the wild, with certain species known to live for over a decade in captivity.</li>
                    <li>Indicators of Environmental Health: Frogs are considered bioindicators, meaning their presence, absence, or behavior can provide valuable insights into the health of ecosystems.</li>
                    <li>Metamorphosis: Frogs undergo a fascinating transformation from tadpoles to adults through the process of metamorphosis, where they develop legs, lose their tails, and transition from water to land.</li>
                    <li>Important Predators: Frogs play a crucial role in controlling insect populations, serving as natural pest controllers by consuming vast quantities of insects, including mosquitoes and agricultural pests.</li>
                </ul>
